# Basic GitHub Commands - README

This README file provides a list of basic Git and GitHub commands that are commonly used for version control and collaboration. Whether you're new to Git or need a quick reference, this guide will help you get started.

## Git Configuration

Before you start using Git, it's important to configure your username and email. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
Replace "Your Name" with your actual name and "your.email@example.com" with your email address.

Creating a Repository
To create a new repository on GitHub, follow these steps:

Go to GitHub and sign in to your account.
Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository".
Provide a name for your repository, choose any other desired settings, and click on "Create repository".
Cloning a Repository
To clone a repository from GitHub to your local machine, use the git clone command followed by the repository URL. For example:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
Replace username with your GitHub username and repository with the name of the repository you want to clone.

Basic Git Workflow
Adding and Committing Changes
Make changes to the files in your local repository.
Use the git status command to see the changes you've made.
Use the git add command to stage the changes for commit. You can specify individual files or use git add . to add all changes.
Use the git commit command to commit the changes with a descriptive message. For example:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Add new feature"
Pushing Changes
To push your committed changes to a remote repository (such as GitHub), use the git push command. For example:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
Replace origin with the name of the remote repository (often "origin") and main with the name of the branch you want to push to.

Pulling Changes
To pull changes from a remote repository to your local repository, use the git pull command. For example:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
Replace origin with the name of the remote repository (often "origin") and main with the name of the branch you want to pull from.

Branching
Git allows you to work with branches, which are independent lines of development. Here are some basic commands related to branching:

git branch: List all branches in your repository.
git branch <branch-name>: Create a new branch with the specified name.
git checkout <branch-name>: Switch to the specified branch.
git merge <branch-name>: Merge the changes from the specified branch into the current branch.
